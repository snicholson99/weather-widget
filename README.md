A small, reusable widget that allows the user to see the weather forecast for their area.

### Build Instructions
    git clone https://github.com/snicholson99/weather-widget  
    cd ./weather-widget

### MVP
1. Show the user's current location.
2. Use the https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 API to show the user's 5 day weather forecast.
3. Show the weather for each day in a clean, concise manner.

### Further Implementation (achieved)
1. Show the current population for the user's location.
2. Add relevant icons to view the forecast at a glance.

### Further Implementation (outside of time constraint)
1. Render the results arranged by day of week.
2. Allow the user to search for a specific location.
3. Show a larger graphic to display current weather.
4. Add more data available from https://openweathermap.org/.
